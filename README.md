# Improved Network Routing via Hybrid Metaheuristics

The ability to efficiently manage and direct data traffic within a network is paramount in today's interconnected world.
The primary goals of network routing are :
1. Optimal Routing: Network routing aims to find the optimal path for data packets to reach their destination efficiently.
2. Network Monitoring and Description: Network routing also involves understanding and describing the network's behavior, such as identifying bottlenecks or congestion points.

This project focuses on optimizing network routing for efficient and reliable data transfer using a combination of metaheuristic search algorithms. The key algorithms utilized in this project include the Genetic Algorithm, Dijkstra's Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm, and the A* Algorithm.

Algorithm Descriptions :-

1. Genetic Algorithm:
The Genetic Algorithm is employed for evolving optimal solutions by mimicking the process of natural selection.

2. Dijkstra's Algorithm:
Dijkstra's Algorithm finds the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, contributing to efficient route selection.

3. Simulated Annealing:
Simulated Annealing is utilized to escape local minima and explore the solution space effectively.

4. Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:
The Floyd-Warshall Algorithm is employed for all-pairs shortest path calculation, aiding in route optimization.

5. A* Algorithm:
The A* Algorithm is included for its ability to efficiently find the shortest path in a graph with heuristics.
