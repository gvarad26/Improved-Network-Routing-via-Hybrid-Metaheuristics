# Improved-Network-Routing-via-Hybrid-Metaheuristics
The ability to efficiently manage and direct data traffic within a network is paramount in today's interconnected world. Network routing primarily deals with determining the optimal path for data packets to travel from a source to a destination within a computer network. Preprocessing, organization, and integration of data are also significant concerns in network routing. The entire process of using computer-based methodologies and algorithms to make decisions about how data should flow through a network is known as network routing.
The algorithms implimented are :

1)Genetic Algorithm

2)A-Star

3)Simulated Annealing

4)Dijkstras Algorithm

5)Floyd Warshall Algorithm
